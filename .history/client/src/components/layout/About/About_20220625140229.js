                    <p>Bookworm is a general name for any insect that is said to bore through books.[1][2]

The damage to books that is commonly attributed to "bookworms" is, in truth, not caused by any species of worm. Often, the larvae of various types of insects including beetles, moths and cockroaches, which may bore or chew through books seeking food, are responsible.</p>
